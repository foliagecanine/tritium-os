# Compiling Programs

Welcome to COMPILING.MD. Here you will find how to compile programs for TritiumOS.

## Compiling
### Requirements
For assembly programs
 - NASM, GAS, or other assembler for x86  
 - i686-tritium-ld (or equivelant, untested)
 
For C programs
 - i686-tritium-gcc compiler (May work with other compilers such as clang, but untested)
 - i686-tritium-ld (or equivelant, untested)
 - GNU Make (recommended)
 
### Compiling Assembly
For assembly programs, simply write the code as you would.
Compile it with (NASM): 
```bash
nasm -felf32 input.asm
i686-tritium-ld input.o -o OUTPUT.PRG
```
  
### Compiling C
For C programs, it's a little more complicated.
It is recommended to use a program like GNU Make for automation of the compilation.  

Compiling a single C file into an executable (GCC):  
```bash
i686-tritium-gcc main.c -o OUTPUT.PRG
```

Linking multiple C files into an executable (GCC and LD):  
```bash
i686-tritium-gcc -c file1.c
i686-tritium-gcc -c file2.c
i686-tritium-ld file1.o file2.o -o OUTPUT.PRG
```

## Inner Workings
### Variables from the Kernel
The kernel provides four variables in the following registers  
eax: Number of arguments to the main function (argc)  
ebx: Number of environment variables, used by env.c in libc  
ecx: Pointer to char\*\* of arguments (argv)  
edx: Pointer to char\*\* of environment variables  

### Software Interrupts

There are several software interrupt functions available to the user process.  
They can be called by putting the function number in eax and calling `int 0x80` (or "int $0x80" in GAS)

```C
int 0x80, eax=0: terminal writestring  
Arguments:  
ebx = (char *)string : String to write

This function simply prints a C string (terminated with 0/NULL) to the terminal.
```

```C
int 0x80, eax=1: exec_syscall
Arguments:
ebx = char  *name     : Program full path
ecx = char **args     : Arguments, terminated by NULL
edx = char **env      : Environment variables, terminated by NULL
Return:
eax = uint32_t pid    : PID of program started. 0 if failed.

This function launches a file as a program. Arguments and environment variables are supplied by callee.
```

```C
int 0x80, eax=2: exit_program  
Arguments:  
ebx = uint32_t status : Exit status

This function exits the program properly. Exit status is given to any programs using waitpid.
```

```C
int 0x80, eax=3: terminal_putentryat  
Arguments:  
bl  = uint8_t c       : Character to print
cl  = uint8_t color   : Color of character (foreground and background)
edx = size_t x        : X location on screen. Can be 0-79
esi = size_t y        : Y location on screen. Can be 0-24

This function puts a character at a specific point on the screen
```

```C
int 0x80, eax=4: getchar  
Return:
al  = char c          : Character typed on keyboard. NULL if there is none.

This function gets a character typed on the keyboard
```

```C
int 0x80, eax=5: get_kbddata  
Return:
eax  = uint32_t k      : Keyboard packet. See below.

Keyboard packet:

| Bits |   Description    |
|-------------------------|
| 0:7  | Kbd scancode     |
| 8:15 | Character        |
| 16   | Ctrl Key Status  |
| 17   | Shift Status     |
| 18   | Alt Key Status   |
| 19   | Numlock Status   |
| 20   | Scroll Lock Stat |
| 21   | Capslock Status  |
|22:31 | Unused           |

This function gets a detailed packet about a key typed on the keyboard, as well as the status of control keys (Alt, Shift, etc.)
```

```C
int 0x80, eax=6: yield

Prematurely give control to another program in the queue. Useful when waiting for time-sensitive things like delays or keyboard input.

```C
int 0x80, eax=9, bl=1: terminal_option.getcursor
Return:
eax = uint32_t cursor : Cursor position in format (0x0000<<16) | (x<<8) | (y)
